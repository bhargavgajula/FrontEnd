    <title>Whispers of the Wind</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
    In the quiet of twilight's embrace,<br>
    Where shadows dance with gentle grace,<br>
    The wind unveils its whispered tale,<br>
    A story spun in a soft, rhythmic hail.<br><br>

    Through rustling leaves, secrets are sown,<br>
    In nature's hush, a symphony is known.<br>
    Branches sway in a mystical dance,<br>
    A waltz of whispers, a fleeting trance.<br><br>

    Moonlight weaves through the silken air,<br>
    A celestial spotlight, tender and rare.<br>
    Stars above, silent witnesses they keep,<br>
    To the lullaby that the night winds reap.<br><br>

    Listen close to the wind's soft song,<br>
    A melody ancient, enduring and strong.<br>
    It tells of journeys, of love untold,<br>
    In the language of the breeze, stories unfold.<br>
